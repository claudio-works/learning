## Brand Card Systems

Exploring how brand identity shapes product card design through Nike variations and style comparisons.

## Project Goal
After practicing basic product cards, I want to dive deeper into how the same product can look completely different depending on brand presentation. This project will focus on creating multiple Nike shoe cards for different audiences, plus exploring contrasting design approaches.

## Plan
Nike Variations to Build:

 - Running theme - Clean, performance-focused
 - Lifestyle theme - Trendy, fashion-forward
 - Limited edition theme - Premium, exclusive feel

## What I'm Learning

- Brand consistency vs. audience targeting
- How typography affects perception
- Color psychology in different contexts
- Strategic design thinking
